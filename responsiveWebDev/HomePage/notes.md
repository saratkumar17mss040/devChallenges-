âš¡ My process:

1. Start thinking about the layout both desktop and mobile design and start building for one

<!-- Add 2 to 3 pointer on how you would approach building just the layout - bare bones -->
<!-- Decided will start with desktop first but also will keep in mind of mobile - reduce writing and overwrting css lol :) -->

1. Navbar can be flexbox 
2. Starting from HeroImgSection the design seems to have some fixed margin on left and right except for the heroImg which it is extending outside  -Content are lfet positioned in desktop
3. ServiceSection is flexbox
4. DesignSection is flexbox - lets hope i can implement it in flexbox
    Make sure the see more likn is within the sectioncard 
5. TeamSection is flexbox where img cards inside will need grid or flexbox again
6. ReviewSection is flexbox
7. FooterSection is flexbox with equal flex-items

Tip: Do visualization if you want to.

2. Once you have an overall idea about building the layout, then start to think about what are all the designs and layouts repeated - Kind - search for patterns and styles which can be reused.

3. Then start building the bare bone html structure with basic css utlis and set   up typography and colors.

4. Start adding additional css styles and build for either mobile or desktop.    Here, html and css goes hand to hand.

Components (more-like containers):
        Navbar
        HeroSection
        ServicesOfferedSection
            ServiceCard - When hovereds it should show the border and box-shadow effect with custom hand icon
        DesignSection
        TeamSection
        ReviewSection
        FooterSection 

Reusable Component:
        EmailInput

Finally do much as possible, if you get stuck - debug if you cant and no help is there then style a bit differently and move on !!!
